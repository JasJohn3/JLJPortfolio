          <h3 class="mb-0">Early Life</h3>
          <p>In my early adult years, I experienced a great deal of hardship.  I first attended UAT at 19, but it was a short-lived venture.  During those first two semesters, I lost my Biological Mother to Cancer, I lost my job, and eventually became homeless.  During my homeless phase, I would wash myself in the sinks at UAT and helped a young Man with Muscular Dystrophy for enough money to eat.  As one can imagine, the struggle became too difficult and I was forced to leave school and find another path through life.</p>
          <br>
          <h3 class="mb-0">Military Biography</h3>
          <p>I struggled for many years with poverty, with seemingly no end in sight.  I realized I needed something that was stable with continuous opportunity for growth.  That is when I joined the Military.  It afforded Financial Stability, Upward Progression, Discipline, and most of all, the ability to serve a cause greater than myself.</p>
          <br>
          <p>During my time in the Army, I found great success and achievement.  It helped me to find a confidence that no other job had ever afforded.  I was promoted to a Non-Commissioned Officer or NCO for short, where my new found leadership responsibilities would be put to the test in Combat.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I was deployed to Iraq in early 2011 as a new NCO.  During my time overseas, I would face many new challenges, and most of all, overcome those challenges.  During my first month in country, we had to operate at Emergency Manning Levels, causing each of our soldiers to work 90+ hours per week.</p>
          <br>
          <p>To help alleviate this stress factor, I accomplished a six-month training program in under a month.  This would allow me to be a certified Air Traffic Controller and be promoted to the Tower Training Supervisor.  This promotion then gave our Company the ability to eliminate the Emergency Manning Levels and return to a traditional 40 hours, instead of 90+.</p>
          <br>
          <p>While deployed we would be attacked on over 50 separate occasions.  On one particular occasion, we had a rather serious rocket attack.  During the attack, a building was destroyed and set on fire.  I was able to successfully evacuate the airspace with no casualties, deploy Quick Reactionary Force, and have first responders on the scene in under three minutes.  Because of this, I was selected by my Company to meet the Division Commander for my performance.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Upon meeting the Division Commander, I was asked to represent the Division for the Audie Murphy Competition.  The Audie Murphy Competition is a National competition for the top NCOâ€™s in the Army.  I was flown via black hawk to Baghdad where I would perform my final board with the Vice Command Sergeant Major and Vice Commanding General of the Iraq campaign.  I not only won the Audie Murphy medal, but I was also the Top Contestant among three others selected that year, receiving special recognition from the Vice Commanding General for my accomplishments.  Too date, I am the only Arizona National Guardsmen to have ever received the Award.  It is one of my Greatest accomplishments.</p>
          <br>
          <p>After returning from Iraq, I would continue thriving and progressing.  I was given one of the greatest jobs I have ever held, helping soldiers gain access to college education.  I was originally selected as the GI Bill Manager.  However, because of my performance, I would be given three additional state projects to manage and be promoted to the Education Guidance Counselor, and promoted to a Staff Sergeant.  </p>
          <br>
          <p>However, my time in Iraq had caused an unforeseen consequence.  Roughly about a year and a half after returning, I would be inundated with severe PTSD, Bipolar and Amnesia.  These three conditions sadly forced me into a medical retirement and left me disabled for a number of years.</p>
          <br>
          <h3 class="mb-0">Recovery and New Beginnings</h3>
          <p>After leaving the Military, I chose a very different path.  Because of the mental conditions I was experiencing, I needed to find a way to heal myself.  I found the perfect place, Southwest Institute of Healing Arts.  I would attend this university and receive a Massage License and Yoga Teacher certifications.  It was these two artful paths that helped me learn inner peace.  That inner peace would allow me to return from the difficult past I had endured.   Although I loved the work, I knew that massage was not enough to fulfill my deeper desires of helping the world.</p>
          <br>
          <h3 class="mb-0">Return to UAT</h3>
          <p>One day, I happened to drive by the UAT sign on Baseline.  Seeing that sign suddenly ignited my old passions and desires from early child hood.  As a child, I did not have the resources to finish school.  However, after my Military Service, I had been given a new found opportunity to complete my education through the GI Bill.</p>
          <br>
          <p>My time at UAT introduced me to many new passions. In particular, my drive to understand Artificial Intelligence and merging AI with Automation.  This represents the ability to achieve my greatest goal, to leave the world a better place than I found it.</p>
          <br>
          <h3 class="mb-0">Holistic and Sustainable Community Development</h3>
          <p>My dream goal is to utilize AI and Automation for creating sustainable communities.  This includes sustainable housing that generates more power than it uses, and generates more food then the residents require.  The idea being, if every home generates electricity and food, it eliminates the survival needs of the common person.  Therefore, instead of Automation being something to fear, it is something that can be embraced creating new degrees of freedom for everyone.  </p>
          <br>
          <p>Instead of jobs being the primary source of survival, hobbies can become the new jobs of the future. Automation can handle the majority of the labor needs of society, while humans can be free to pursue their personal passions as a daily living.</p>
          <br>
          <h3 class="mb-0">A Brighter Future for Everyone</h3>
          <p>As I have experienced great suffering, it has given me great drive and ambition to make change. That is why I believe firmly in one ideal, to elevate your neighbor is to elevate yourself. When we work together for the common good of all, we work for our own benefit as well.  Creating symbiotic relationships with the environment is the best way for all beings on the planet.  Instead of concrete buildings, creating edible gardens and incorporating Nature into the design of all our buildings offsets CO2 emissions while simultaneously providing great health benefits.  Delivering these kinds of sustainable designs and automated construction technologies can help improve the quality of life for everyone.</p>
